About the project:

As a part of our Software Engineering Lab course project, we are building  ‘ExamTime’, a multiple user-type system with the Django Rest Framework and React. We'll be building an online school system where teachers can create assignments that students can complete and view their results, thereby promoting peer-to-peer learning and boosting productivity.



Description of the problem:
	
The current situation of pandemic has resulted in schools shut all across the world.
Nearly 1 billion children are deprived of the classroom. The education system of the country has changed a lot in the past 2 years, thereby growing a new culture of e-learning, where teaching is remote and digital. Exams play an important role in our education system and a necessary step in giving students the correct marks. Scraping exams in higher education is not an option. Online tests keep the momentum of the child learning and ensure his/her learning doesn't stop.



Advantage of school system:

When teachers interact with students in classes, not all students try to answer the question, making it difficult for teachers to assume whether students have understood the topic or not. Therefore, ‘ExamTime’ is a free application to involve all students in the learning and feedback process.
 	The assessment will be posted by the teacher on our application where they can judge students based on the assessment. Teachers can maintain students' performance based on the result of their assessment. The result will be recorded and saved so that teachers can work on student’s weaknesses and improve them.

 


What will our system do?

Our application will allow teachers to create test sheets for quizzes in a few minutes. Students can then fill out those forms and view their results in their profiles. Based on the results teachers can maintain students' reports and guide them. It will be a free online tool for conducting online examinations easily and effectively providing separate systems for teacher and student .





Justification that the proposal is neither too easy nor too ambitious

Considering the month of December as our deadline, we have 3 months to finish our software and implement all the promised features. Since the team size is relatively small and the project deadline is very close considering the size of the project, we have decided to follow the "SCRUM Software Development Lifecycle Model", which puts greater emphasis on quickly changing requirements of the clients(schools). The Scrum model focuses on short, sharp delivery of projects after every (sprint) providing sufficient time for feedback from the client and thereby easily making changes in the next sprint hence saving a lot of time and resources for debugging and general overhead.

The proposal is neither too easy as we have promised to implement a multitude of features, whereas not neglecting any security issues and any kind of loopholes in classroom structure to reduce plagiarism as much as possible. Thus, we must devote a
significant amount of time to testing and error handling in general. The SCRUM Model encourages frequent sprints, hence evolving code and making the project undergo rigorous testing in each sprint thereby making the code more and more optimized and less prone to bugs and errors by the end of every sprint. Moreover, some features are dependent on other features already being implemented, hence, there will be some bottlenecking due to dependencies so to reduce them and since we also plan to make detailed testing and final code optimizing before submitting the project to the client, We believe the proposal is neither too easy nor too ambitious. 




Customer

Consider a school, or a university, which has moved education to the online mode due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The institute wants their students not to lag behind with their education. They wish to develop a software for students, where they conduct their test/assessment online.This will help students to boost their knowledge and maintain competition among them.



Section 2 - Feasibility Report 

1. Overview of the Existing Systems and Technologies

Our system resembles most of Google Forms which is a famous and popular platform. Google form supports functions like online quizzes and surveys. Our application too supports real time quizzes, in addition to it our application will be more suited to educational institutes ,where teachers and students will have separate user systems. Students will have their separate profile.




2. Scope of the Project

Main actors of this system:-
School/University and other educational institutes
Signup/Login
Post test online for students
Maintain record of students data
Students
Signup/Login
Do the test/assessment in real time
Maintain their profile which includes test results




3. Deliverables

We will be developing a RESTful API for our application, which will include all the necessary features for the project. A web application that will allow educational institutes to post their test online. Allows students to fill the test and see their results in their profile.



4. Feasibility Study

​4.1 Financial Feasibility

Being a web application ‘ExamTime’ will have an associated hosting cost. Since the system doesn’t consist of any multimedia data transfer, bandwidth required for the operation of this application is very low. The system will follow the freeware software standards. No cost will be charged from the potential customers. We will be using free and open-source software for developing our project, which are available at no charge. Bug fixes and maintaining tasks will have an associated cost.  Beside the associated cost, there will be many benefits for the customers. From these it’s clear that the project ‘ExamTime’  is financially feasible.


 


4.2 Technical Feasibility

Project ‘ExamTime’ is a complete web based application. The main technologies and tools that are associated with ‘ExamTime’ are :
HTML
CSS
JS
REACT
REDUX
REST API
ANTD
DJANGO
DJANGO REST FRAMEWORK


Each of the technologies are freely available and the technical skills required are manageable. Time limitations of the product development and the ease of implementing using these technologies are synchronized. Initially the web site will be hosted in a free web hosting space, but for later implementations it will be hosted in a paid web hosting space with sufficient bandwidth. Bandwidth required in this application is very low, since it doesn’t incorporate any multimedia aspect. From these it’s clear that the project ‘ExamTime’ is technically feasible.  




4.3 Resource and Time Feasibility

Resources that are required for the proper implementation of this project are:
1. Programming devices like personal computers, workstations, or laptops.
2. Hosting space on the local domain (freely available)
3. Programming tools
4. Programming individuals.
5. Web and Hosting services for client-server flow and the time required to store and process this information is negligible for the modern-day processors which work at very high clock speed.
6. SQLite Storage for cloud storage (freely available for the development phase). Since it is an open-source freely available storage so it would be perfectly feasible for this project.
Thus, it’s evident that this system has the required resource and time feasibility. 



4.4 Risk Feasibility
Risk feasibility can be discussed under several contexts-:
The risk associated with size:
Estimated size of the product in line of codes: ‘ExamTime’ will contain a significant amount of code lines. As the system doesn’t contain any multimedia aspect, the file sizes and the complete project size will not exceed 	20MB. 
Business impact risks: 
A number of customers(schools) who will use this product and the consistency of their needs relative to the product: This system can support any number of formats that several schools opt for because of its flexibility of code and available features.
Development environment risks:
Are compilers or code generators available and appropriate for the product to be built? Python will be used as the main scripting language. All the libraries and interpreters will be freely available.
Are testing tools available and appropriate for the product to be built? Django’s Test Client is the main testing tool that will be used. Django’s Test Client is a freely available tool that supports automated testing.
 Are software configuration management tools available? Configuration management will be done using GIT that is freely available. 
Does the environment make use of a database or repository?SQLite database which is a relational database will be used in this project as it is open source, most flexible and fast because of relational characteristics of the database.	
ExamTime will follow the Scrum Software Development Process. This provides the flexibility to adapt to changing software requirements of ExamTime which are asked by the customer(respective school) in a short period of time (sprint) as several features are to be implemented by the deadline which is by the end of November( approximately 3 months). 
 
Technical issue risks-
Are specific conventions for code documentation defined and used? Software code will be freely available on Github and the code documentation will be provided.
Do you use a specific method for test case design? Python Test Client will be used as the main testing tool that automates the testing process.
Are configuration management software tools used to control and track change activities throughout the software process? GIT will be used throughout the software implementation process.

Technology risks
Is the technology to be built new? All the technologies are very well established and old enough (but not obsolete).


4.5 Social/Legal Feasibility

The project uses freely available development tools and provides the system as an open-source system, freely available on GitHub for anyone to use and further enhance their knowledge by freely contributing to the project which will help in enhancing the knowledge of the society/individual who uses it.

1.0 Purpose 1.1 Introduction The purpose of this document is to present a detailed description of the Class Management and Notes Sharing Application. This app would help students to organize their schedules, and share useful notes and resources with their peers, thereby promoting peer-to-peer learning and boosting productivity. This software system is a Class Management System for students. This system will be designed to maximize the student’s productivity by providing tools to assist in scheduling and setting reminders for classes, which would otherwise have to be performed manually. Furthermore, the system will allow students to set deadlines for projects and assignments, thereby ensuring that they can complete their tasks efficiently. Moreover, this system also allows a student to share notes with other students. The system will automatically organize these notes into folders according to the subject for ease of access.Since this software will serve as a virtual classroom hence teachers can also use this software to interact with the class and also will serve as a one centralised place to organise exams and tests . 1.2 Scope The scope of this software project is vast and is not just confined to the IIIT Gwalior , This software can be used by any institute / college or even an elementary school which can use the luxury of this software to establish a virtual classroom among the students and their teachers to enhance their communication and interaction thereby increasing the efficiency of the day to day chores of classroom, which inturn will help in improving the standards of education of the institute which would be directly reflected in scorecards of the students. 1.3 References We have primarily taken references from wikipedia and official documentation of Django , React and Python which have helped us immensely in writing this documentation . We have also taken reference from the official Google Classroom application which is our main competitor in this domain,so as to understand its shortcomings and thereby improve our product over google classroom. 3
1.4 Document Overview There are 2 Sections in this document left to discuss, the first providing a full description of the project for the owners of the Software . It lists all the functions performed by the system. The Section 3 concerns details of each of the system functions and actions in full for the software developers’ assistance. These two sections are cross-referenced by topic; to increase understanding by both groups involved. 1.5. Competitive Landscape Our product serves a niche market, that is why there are multiple partial competitors who provide one or two of the services that we are providing but none of them provide the complete collection of services nor are they aimed at solving the particular problem we are solving. The biggest competitor for us would be Google Classrooms, which is a virtual classroom application which helps students to attend online classes and teachers to create assignments that will appear on the student’s calendar thereby improving efficiency. We are more aimed towards enabling peer-to-peer learning, notes sharing and organizing. Our advantage over Classroom is that we automatically classify notes into folders so that everything is already organized for the students, which is something that Google Classroom doesn’t offer. As per reports from an employee, who was an ex-Google Software engineer, Google Classroom isn't thinking about this feature in the near future, thus, we have an unexplored market in front of us. Another competitor would be Discord, but it is an application mainly aimed towards Video Gamers. Slack could be a potential substitution. Our advantage over Slack is that we are extremely organized, compared to Slack, where anybody can create a channel and spam texts. Slack does not have an automatic notes classifier, or a scheduler for deadlines as well, another point which makes us the better alternative. Since this is a niche market it has both risks and rewards, but since we are the only option, the rewards far outweigh the risks. 2.0. Overall description EXAMTIME (web app) contains various files containing information from the User Database, which is itself divided into subgroups, containing student’s information and teacher’s information. Our system is a full stack web application, linking EXAMTIME to a remote web server using a standard web browser. Students and Teachers must require an Internet connection to access our system. 4
2.1. System environment Teachers can add their assignments to the database. Students can submit these assignments in real time through our web applications. These assignments are fetched from the institute database by the local institute servers.These assignments are then provided to students, their responses are stored in these servers. Their marks are also displayed depending upon their responses . 2.2. Functional requirements definitions Functional Requirements are those that refer to the functionality of the system, i.e., what services it will provide to the user.

System Evolution We plan to evolve our product in future variation as there is a huge market for this product moreover several innovations in this domain of ed-tech are still untouched , We currently plan to add feature of video call and audio call in the virtual classroom moreover we also plan to add a feature of multiple channels within a single classroom which will provide the flexibility of effectively and efficiently forming small teams in a classroom for the teacher to assign task to each group and conveniently monitor them. 3.4 Security By default, Django prevents most common security mistakes: ● XSS (cross-site scripting) protection — Django template system by default escapes variables, unless they are explicitly marked as safe. ● CSRF (cross site request forgery) protection — easy to turn on globally, guarantees that forms (POST requests) are sent from your own site. ● SQL injection protection — Django uses built-in ORM, thus there is no risk of SQL injection (raw queries are possible, but by no means something that a beginner would need to use). ● Clickjacking protection — Django can detect when the content is requested from unauthorized iframe ● Safe password hash — Django by default uses PBKDF2, another option is bcrypt. Even an admin can’t see a hashed password. 16
